# ListApp
Single Page Web Application

The name of the solution says desire application but I meant List Application. This project was started to determine whether it is simpler to write a single page application instead of multiple pages for smaller application designs. In this case it's a list application where the user enters the title of the list and can then use CRUD operations to manipulate the items in the new list.
